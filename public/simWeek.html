        <h1>Event Branding and Social Media</h1>
        <p>Client: Simulations Week <br><br>Simulations Week is an annual week-long simulation event for youth ages 12-18. It’s also one of the projects I’ve been most passionate about during my years of doing graphic design work. After attending the event as a
            participant for the previous five years, I was invited to re-design the event’s branding as well as create an online presence for it. <br><br>Project Duties: (all completed within a month and a half) <br><br>Create event logo Design website <br>Make themed headers
            for the event sign-up page <br>Create illustrated t-shirt that featured busts of the adult mentors <br>Create themed Facebook Page <br>Generate weekly content for Social Media <br>Create various signs, propaganda flyers, and pamphlets for use during the event.
            <br><br>Logo Design: Because the event’s title, “Simulations Week,” (which was frequently abbreviated to “Sim-Week”) was already well known among its fans, it was decided that adding an icon to the name would take too much time to introduce to the
            audience, ultimately only distracting from the company’s presence. To accommodate this challenge I designed a slim font, text-based logo. Website: I designed a website whose primary design was to get participants excited for the year’s theme
            of “dystopian political warfare with a steampunk twist.” Facebook Page: I made a Facebook page for the company with themed header and profile images, then began to generate post content such as: A set of square hype images for social media
            to be released once a week Youth testimonial videos of previous participants. These videos were released right before the early-bird registration deadline to let potential participants see old friends encouraging them to sign up. Reflecting
            back on this project 3 years later, I’m very proud of the large amount of content I was able to create in a small amount of time. One thing I would change however is my design of the event logo, which in hindsight was difficult to read. I’ve
            taken the liberty of re-designing the logo while following my current logo design process, and the result is a new design that still matches the event’s branding while being much more readable, functional, and scalable. This project taught
            me quite a bit and allowed me to essentially be a one-man show in charge of all the event’s design needs, expanding my ability to handle all kinds of company design duties. </p>
